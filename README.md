# State Estimation of Pipe Inspection Gauge using EKF and UKF
This repository contains the code and report for a final project in the course **EL2320 Applied Estimation** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. The project focuses on the state estimation of a Pipe Inspection Gauge (PIG) as it travels through a pipeline, utilising two widely used nonlinear filtering techniques: the **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** and the **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**. We implement both filters, compare their performance and analyse their strengths and limitations in estimating the PIGâ€™s position and velocity in various scenarios.

The project includes:
- Matlab implementation of EKF and UKF
- Performance analysis and error evaluation
- Final report
